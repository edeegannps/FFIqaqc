\description{
The `tree_area_multiplier_qc` function conducts quality control checks on subplot
fractions for different tree categories based on Diameter at Breast Height (DBH).
It classifies trees into `pole` (DBH < 15.1), `overstory` (DBH â‰¥ 15.1), and `blank`
(missing or blank DBH). For overstory trees, the function ensures that all have a
subplot fraction (`SubFrac`) of 1. For pole trees, it verifies a subplot fraction of 0.5.
For trees with blank or missing DBH, the function checks for a subplot fraction of 1000
(specific to Saguaros monitoring program) or blank. The results are stored in the `flags`
variable, containing details about events where subplot fractions deviate from the
specified criteria, and are returned by the function.
